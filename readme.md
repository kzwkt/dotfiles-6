# **Dotfiles**
-------
_Hello there!_

and welcome to my ever increasing setup dotfiles repo.

I've created individual branches for individual setups of mine.

If there's a suffix like -arch or -manjaro in a branch name it simply means that those setups are better adapted to their corresponding distro.

I've tried to attach installation scripts and screenshots to most of my branches, along with a descriptive readme file which tells about the status etc.

If you try them out and find something which can be fixed or improved do make a pull request!

_**Thank you!**_
